Test Run (The "Dry Run"):

Change EPOCHS = 1 and N_FOLDS = 1 temporarily in the code.

Run it for 2 minutes to make sure it loads data, starts training, and saves a checkpoint without crashing.

Then change them back to EPOCHS = 20 and N_FOLDS = 5.

Before you start training ConvNeXt, rename the current checkpoints folder to checkpoints_swin.
